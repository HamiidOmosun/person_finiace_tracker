A personal finance tracker CLI (Command Line Interface) app works by letting users manage their income, 
expenses, budgets, and financial goals directly through text-based commands. 
Here's a breakdown of how it typically works:

1. User Input via Commands

The user types commands like:
 - ask user the task they want to perfom
 - show a menu 
 - perform choosen task

2. Data Storage

 All financial entries (expenses, incomes) are saved.
 Storage can be:

   A local file (like JSON, CSV, or plain text)
   A lightweight database (like SQLite)
   Cloud-based (if more advanced)

3. Categorization

 Each transaction usually includes:

   Amount
   Type (income or expense)
   Category (e.g., rent, groceries, entertainment)
   Date (defaults to current date or user-specified)

4. Calculations & Summaries

 The app processes stored data to show:

   Total income and expenses
   Balance (income - expenses)
   Breakdown by category
   Daily, weekly, or monthly summaries

5. Budgeting

 Users can optionally set budgets:

   For overall spending
   Per category (e.g., \$200/month for food)
 The app warns or informs users when they're near or over their limit.

6. Reporting and Exporting

 The app can show reports like:

   “What did I spend the most on last month?”
   “How much am I saving per month?”
 Some apps offer exporting data to CSV or other formats.

7. Persistence and Reuse

 Users can quit and relaunch the app, and their data persists.
 Some offer command history or recurring entries.

8. Optional Features

 Password protection or encryption for data
 Multi-currency support
 Integration with online APIs (e.g., currency exchange rates)
